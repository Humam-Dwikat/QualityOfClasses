# QualityOfClass
This is my first attempt to play with Java and to apply OOP principles
### how I think in this project
this project is Building a student enrollment system for the University
so I saw that I needed to make a University as an Interface 
that will help us if there is another university that wants to build a different behavior 
so it will make implements for University(Interface) and do the behavior that want

### explanation
we have a university system that helps 
to enroll students and all operations about students
this is the "Interface"
each university must have Students and Courses
and each student has a list of courses

-IUniversity
  - NajahUN - students courses
  - OxfordUN
- Student- have a list of courses
